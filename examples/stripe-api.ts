     * object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
     * event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
     * events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
     * customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
     * `charge.succeeded` event.
     * 
     * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
     * resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
     * example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
     * `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.
     * 
     * As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
     * [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
     * from the API. We also have a separate
     * [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
     * `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
     * in your
     * [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
     * and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.
     * 
     * When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
     * events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
     * additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
     * 
     * **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is
     * guaranteed only for 30 days.

     * @description A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
     * For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
     * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
     * 
     * Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
     * Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
     * The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
     * you through the setup process.
     * 
     * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
     * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
     * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
     * in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
     * If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
     * it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
     * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
     * PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
     * 
     * By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
     * even as regulations change over time.

     * Token

     * account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
     * your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
     * returned to your server to use. You should use our
     * [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
     * client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
     * and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
     * 
     * If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
     * the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
     * your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
     * that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
     * client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
     * Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.
     * 
     * Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
     * information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
     * objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that
     * [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
     * performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

           * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.
           * 
           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.
           * 
           * `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be passed when creating a subscription.
           *

           * Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).
           * 
           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

Creating subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.
           * 
           * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.
           * 
           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.

This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.
           * 
           * Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using [pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates). When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the parameters [supported by pending updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).
           * 
           * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn more.
