  The response will be a JSON object with a key called `certificate`. The value
  of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes associated
  with a certificate.

  When using Let's Encrypt, the initial value of the certificate's `state`
  attribute will be `pending`. When the certificate has been successfully
  issued by Let's Encrypt, this will transition to `verified` and be ready for use.
