  The response will be a JSON object with a key called `domain_records`. The
  value of this will be an array of domain record objects, each of which
  contains the standard domain record attributes. For attributes that are not
  used by a specific record type, a value of `null` will be returned. For
  instance, all records other than SRV will have `null` for the `weight` and
  `port` attributes.
