**Description**

_A brief description of the issue. _

_[Link to the OpenAPI version & spec description](#)_

**OpenAPI**

```yaml
# Your OpenAPI schema (can be a stub)
```

**Generated TS**

```ts
// What’s generated in the current version (or put “nothing” if it’s skipped)
```

**Expected TS*

```ts
// What you’d like to see generated
```

**Checklist**

- [ ] My OpenAPI schema passes a validator
- [ ] I’m willing to open a PR for this (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/drwpow/openapi-typescript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))
